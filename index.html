            8/25/23-This is my first journal entry. We used pipes and marbles today to learn how to work together and figure out a better solution to a problem. Our team lost but we still figured out a couple tricks.

            9/11/23 - This is my second journal entry. We CADed our rube golber machine and started to cut out the cardboard. I enjoyed it a lot and it was very fun to work with my team.

            9/15/23-This is my third journal entry. We just finished our rube golber machines and tested it a few times. It worked nicely and is very simple. Thankfully, it worked every time that we tried it. There was a couple times when we came to a thinking block in our group but we thought about the restraints and criteria of the project and figured out a good solution to the problem.

            9/29/23-This is my fourth journal entry. This week, we disected computers and learned about computer engineering. Computer engineering is a very broad engineering field and contain brnahces such as comp sci, software, and coding. From the disection, I learned the different parts of the computer and where they belong.

            10/6/23- This is my fifth entry journal. This week, we made prosthetic hands to simulate what biomedical engineers do constantly. Me and my partner had to think of the contraints of the project and how the hand would pick up the bottle. We made makeshift "straws" to keep the strings in place and to bend the joints of our hand. The hand worked almost every single time and was easy to make.

            10/20/23- This is my sixth journal entry. This week, we made rockets to mimick aerospace engineering. Our design was half a bottle ontop of another with fins and a tip. Unfortunately, the rocket did not go far due to the excessive weight from the top of the bottle. The first time we tried, the bottle went farther than the second because the tip was damaged during the first run of the rocket so it could fly straight. It was all right since we learned through trial and error.

            10/26/23- This is my seventh journal entry. Today, we made a water filter out of bottles, rocks, sand, and cotton balls to mimic what environmental engineers have to do to filter water. After a couple of tries, me and Catherine realized that it was almost impossible to make the water clear since the yellow color could not be removed with just the materials that were listed. The water was free of sand, dirt, and grime but the yellow tint was still there. The water could not be completely clear without using special bacteria to break down the biological material in the water.

            11/3/23-This is my eigth journal entry. This week, we tried to make an LED light up using batteries, wires, a resistor, and a breadboard on TinkerCad. The two outermost rows on both sides transfered energy in columns while the middle rows transfered energy horizontally. After a couple experiments, I managed to get it after rechecking that the energy was flowing in the right direction.
