            8/25/23-This is my first journal entry. We used pipes and marbles today to learn how to work together and figure out a better solution to a problem. Our team lost but we still figured out a couple tricks.

            9/11/23 - This is my second journal entry. We CADed our rube golber machine and started to cut out the cardboard. I enjoyed it a lot and it was very fun to work with my team.

            9/15/23-This is my third journal entry. We just finished our rube golber machines and tested it a few times. It worked nicely and is very simple. Thankfully, it worked every time that we tried it.
